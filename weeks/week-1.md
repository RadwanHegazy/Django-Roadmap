# Week 1: Python Basics

Welcome to Week 1 of the Django Roadmap! This week focuses on building a solid foundation in Python programming. You'll learn the fundamental concepts of Python, including syntax, data types, control structures, and basic operations. By the end of this week, you'll be able to write simple Python programs and complete practical tasks.

## Topics Covered

1. **Python Syntax and Basics**
   - Variables and data types (strings, integers, floats, booleans)
   - Basic operators (+, -, *, /, //, %, etc.)
   - Input and output (print, input)
   - Comments and documentation

2. **Control Structures**
   - Conditional statements (if, elif, else)
   - Loops (for, while)
   - Break and continue statements

3. **Data Structures**
   - Lists
   - Tuples
   - Dictionaries
   - Sets

4. **Functions**
   - Defining functions
   - Parameters and return values
   - Scope and global variables

5. **File Handling**
   - Reading and writing files
   - Working with text files

### Arabic Resources
- [Osama Elzero Python Basics Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDoPjvoNmBAyE_gei5d18qkfIe-Z8mocs) (Videos 1-80, recommended 3-4 videos per day)

## Tasks

Complete these tasks to practice what you've learned. Aim to finish them by the end of the week.

### Task 1: Calculator
Create a Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input.

**Requirements:**
- Ask the user for two numbers
- Ask the user for an operation (+, -, *, /, //, %)
- Perform the calculation and display the result
- Handle division by zero errors
- Allow the user to perform multiple calculations in a loop

**Example Output:**
```
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Enter operation (+, -, *, /, //, %): +
Result: 15

Do you want to perform another calculation? (y/n): y
```

### Task 2: Simple Todo System
Build a basic command-line todo application that allows users to create, read, and delete tasks.

**Requirements:**
- Display a menu with options: Add Task, View Tasks, Delete Task, Exit
- Store tasks in a list
- Implement functions for each menu option
- Use a loop to keep the program running until the user chooses to exit
- Add input validation (e.g., check if task exists before deleting)

**Example Output:**
```
Todo System Menu:
1. Add Task
2. View Tasks
3. Delete Task
4. Exit

Choose an option: 1
Enter task: Learn Python basics
Task added successfully!

Choose an option: 2
Your Tasks:
1. Learn Python basics

Choose an option: 4
Goodbye!
```

## Tips for Success

- Practice coding every day, even if it's just 30 minutes
- Don't hesitate to look up documentation or ask for help
- Experiment with the code examples from the videos
- Focus on understanding concepts rather than memorizing syntax
- Use online Python interpreters like Repl.it or Python's IDLE for quick testing

## Next Steps

Once you've completed the tasks, move on to Week 2: Python OOP. Review your code and think about how you can improve it using object-oriented principles.

Good luck! If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the community or refer back to the main README.md.
