## Tasks

### Task 1: Django Installation and Setup
Set up Django on your system and create your first project.

**Requirements:**
- Install Django using pip
- Create a new Django project
- Run the development server
- Access the Django welcome page
- Explore the project structure

**Commands:**
```bash
pip install django
django-admin startproject myproject
cd myproject
python manage.py runserver
```

### Task 2: Create Your First App
Create a Django app and understand the app structure.

**Requirements:**
- Create a new app (e.g., 'blog' or 'todo')
- Add the app to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py
- Create basic models, views, and templates
- Set up URL routing

**Example App Structure:**
```
myproject/
â”œâ”€â”€ myproject/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ settings.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ urls.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ blog/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ migrations/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ admin.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ apps.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tests.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ urls.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ views.py
â””â”€â”€ manage.py
```

### Task 3: Build a Simple Blog
Create a basic blog application with models, views, and templates.

**Requirements:**
- Create Post model with title, content, author, created_date
- Create views for listing posts and viewing individual posts
- Create templates for post list and post detail
- Set up URL patterns
- Add some sample data via Django shell or admin

**Example Models:**
```python
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class Post(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    content = models.TextField()
    author = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    created_date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    
    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
```

### Task 4: Django Admin Setup
Set up and customize the Django admin interface.

**Requirements:**
- Create a superuser
- Register your models with admin
- Customize admin display (list_display, search_fields)
- Add filters and ordering
- Explore admin customization options

## Tips for Success

- Follow the official Django tutorial alongside the video resources
- Pay attention to Django's project vs app distinction
- Practice the MTV pattern by thinking about each component's role
- Use Django's built-in features before trying to reinvent the wheel
- Read Django's excellent documentation regularly
- Don't worry if it feels overwhelming â€“ Django has a learning curve, but it's worth it

## Next Steps

Congratulations on creating your first Django project! In Week 6, we'll cover Git and GitHub, which are essential for version control and collaboration. Meanwhile, continue exploring Django by adding features to your blog app or creating a new simple app.

Django is powerful, but remember: it's just Python with batteries included. Your Python skills from previous weeks will serve you well here. Keep building! ðŸš€
